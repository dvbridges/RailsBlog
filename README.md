# A simple blog created using Ruby on Rails

This simple web application allows you to Create, Read, Update and Destroy articles <br/>
It is a working version of the [Ruby on Rails: Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) tutorial. <br/>

The web app has basic security measures so create, update and destroy operations require authentication.<br/>
The username and password are set in the ArticlesController, found in `app/controllers/articles_controller.rb`.<br/>

See `blogCreationGuide.md` for steps to create the blog, paraphrased from [Ruby on Rails: Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
